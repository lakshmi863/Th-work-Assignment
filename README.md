 Full-Stack Task Tracker 

As per my I complete full-stack task management application built with Node.js, Express, React, and SQLite. This project was developed to demonstrate core competencies in backend API design, database management, frontend state handling, and deployment to a cloud platform.

The application allows users to create, view, and manage tasks, and provides a simple, rule-based "smart insights" summary of their current workload.
